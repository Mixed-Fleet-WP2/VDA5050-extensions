agvPosition,"Defines the position on a map
in world coordinates.",Removed,state.json,elevator_state.json,Elevator control,"This field includes parameters for continuous localization (e.g., x and y coordinates and rotation), which remain constant for elevators. Since elevators do not require dynamic localization and have no intermediate state while moving between floors, these fields are unnecessary."
batteryState,"Contains all battery-related in-
formation.",Removed,state.json,elevator_state.json,Elevator control,Elevators are typically connected directly to the power grid and do not rely on batteries for normal operation. Battery-related metrics such as estimated reach are not meaningful and do not affect elevator operation.
velocity,"The AGVs velocity in vehicle
coordinates.",Removed,state.json,elevator_state.json,Elevator control,"Elevators exhibit only vertical motion and do not perform planar
movement or rotation. Elevator motion is controlled internally"
loads ,"Loads currently handled by the
AGV.",Removed,state.json,elevator_state.json,Elevator control,"Elevators do not handle loads in the same manner as AGVs, which manage vehicle-mounted cargo. Load management is therefore outside the scope of elevator operations."
safetyState.fieldViolation,"Describes whether a protective
field has been violated",Removed,state.json,elevator_state.json,Elevator control,"Protective fields, as defined for AGVs, are not applicable to elevators because their operation is confined to controlled shafts and does not involve dynamic navigation."

planning.",Removed,state.json,elevator_state.json,Elevator control,Elevators do not perform free navigation and do not adhere to zone-based traffic control.
nodeStates.nodePosition,"Defines the position of a node
that must be traveled to fill an
order in world coordinates",Removed,state.json,elevator_state.json,Elevator control,"In the context of elevators, nodes
represent more abstract floors with
fixed, predefined locations. Because these locations are static and do not change, transmitting node position data in state messages is unnecessary."

edge as a NURBS curve",Removed,state.json,elevator_state.json,Elevator control,Elevator movement follows a fixed vertical path and does not involve navigable trajectories or continuous path geometry.

typeSpecification.navigationTypes,Specifies navigation strategies for AGVs.,Removed,factsheet.json,elevator_factsheet.json,Elevator control,"Autonomous navigation is not applicable to elevators, as their movement is strictly controlled by internal elevator logic along predefined vertical paths."

curve representation"

MANUAL and TEACHING.
Redefined AUTOMATIC. Added
DUAL and LOCAL CONTROL",state.json,elevator_state.json,Elevator control,"AGV operation modes such as SEMIAUTOMATIC, MANUAL, and TEACHING are not applicable to elevators due to fundamental differences in functionality."

transitioning,"Indicates whether the elevator is in the process of moving between floors.",Replaces  driving,state.json,elevator_state.json,Elevator control,"Concepts such as rotation or driving are irrelevant for elevators, as their motion is restricted to vertical travel along a fixed path"

typeSpecification.maxFloors,Maximum number of floors the elevator is capable of traveling as specified by manufacturer,Replaces agvGeometry.envelopes2d,factsheet.json,elevator_factsheet.json,Elevator control,
physicalParameters.speedMin,Minimal controlled continuous speed of the AGV,Removed,factsheet.json,elevator_factsheet.json,Elevator control,"Elevators don’t operate at continuous low speeds: they only accelerate, cruise, and stop. Since an elevator never needs to “drive slowly” like an AGV, this parameter isn’t relevant to elevator operation."

physicalParameters.height,Inner height of the elevator cabin.,Replaces maxHeight and minHeight,factsheet.json,elevator_factsheet.json,Elevator control,Elevator cabin height is uniform and the two fields may be joined together
newBaseRequest,"A field that the AGV can set
to True to indicate that master
control should send a new base
path of nodes (See Section III).
If no base is provided, the
AGV reduces its speed","Semantic modification: when used
by an elevator, setting this field to
True indicates that the elevator requires a new base of floor nodes. Unlike AGVs, this flag does not imply
deceleration",state.json,elevator_state.json,Elevator control,"The original semantics do not align with elevator behavior, as deceleration when approaching floors is predetermined and cannot be influenced by this flag."
